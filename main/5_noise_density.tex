\section{Plot of noise density}
\textit{Plot the noise and integrate over $10kHz < f<100GHz$ (different from AC), which is the lower end of the dynamic range or SNR}

This plot is done without $1/f$-noise of the transistors and therefore results in white noise, which is filtered mainly by the load capacitance. You can see therefore that the cutoff frequency in the noise plot is similar as the cutoff frequency in the closed loop AC analysis for example.
